The results of **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5688477549592576)** were out on 06 May 2019 and guess what I got selected and will be working under **[Sympy](http://sympy.org)** for the next 3 months. I will be working on my project, [Group Theory](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2019-Application-Divyanshu:-Group-Theory), during this period. I am really excited to work with such an amazing organization. I would like to thank all the mentors especially [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) and [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer), for guiding me in my proposal and PR's. The best part is I got my favourite mentor **Kalevi Suominen**.


The first phase is the _Community Bonding Period_, which has nearly come to an end. In this period I mainly focussed on the following things.


 - Setting up blog and synchronizing it with planet sympy.

 - Discussing possible means of communication, weekly meetings etc.

 - Planning the implementation of some of the features of the project with Kalevi.

 - Familiarizing with the codebase of sympy/combinatorics and see how it may help solving the problems while implementing the project.

 - Getting more in-depth theoretical knowledge of the features to be implemented.


Looking forward for a really productive and wonderful summer ahead.
