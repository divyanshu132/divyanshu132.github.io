The sixth week of coding period has ended and a good amount of work has been done on polycyclic groups. Polycyclic presentation, Polycyclic generating sequence(pcgs) and it's series is implemented which for sure need some improvement [sympy/sympy#16991](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16991).

The polycyclic series is computed starting from the bottom of the derived series of a group by adding the missing generators in the subgroups, and collecting these missing generators provide us the polycyclic generating sequence. 

As we discussed last week [here](https://divyanshu132.github.io/gsoc-week-5) that to compute conjugate relators of a polycyclic group we were missing the `RHS` term, which was of the form `x[i]**-1*x[i+1]*x[i] == RHS`. So, starting from the bottom of the polycyclic generating sequence forming the subgroup and finding all the generators of the RHS using `generator_product`, mapping these generators with the free group elements and forming a word, finally collect the above formed word which will give us the collected RHS.

Below is an example to compute polycyclic presentation for S(9).sylow_subgroup(3)

```
>>> from sympy.combinatorics import *
>>> from sympy.combinatorics.free_groups import free_group
>>> F, x0, x1, x2, x3 = free_group("x0, x1, x2, x3")
>>> S = SymmetricGroup(9)
>>> G = S.sylow_subgroup(3)
>>> pc_group = G.polycyclic_group()
>>> group = F
>>> pc_group.pc_presentation(group)
{x3**3: (), x2**3: (), x1**3: (), x0**3: (), x2**-1*x3*x2: x3, x1**-1*x3*x1: x3, x1**-1*x2*x1: x2, x0**-1*x3*x0: x2**2*x3**2, x0**-1*x2*x0: x3, x0**-1*x1*x0: x1*x3}
```

One problem that we've encountered is that the generators in pcgs may change for the same group on executing it several times which makes it difficult to test pc_presentation but, Kalevi advised me to initalize `random.seed` with some chosen value and then it will result in the same repeatable result, will try it by today!

The tasks that I'm hopping to accomplish next week are

 - Add tests for plycyclic presentation and be sure that it works properly.
 - Include more functionalities to pc groups like `exponent_vector`, `element_depth`, `leading_coefficient`.
 - Add documentation for all the functions.

Till then, good byee..
