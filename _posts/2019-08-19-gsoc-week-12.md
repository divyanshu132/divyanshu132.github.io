We've reached to the end of GSoC 2019, end to the really productive and wonderful summer. In the last two weeks I worked on documenting polycyclic groups which got merged as well, here is the PR [sympy/sympy#17399](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17399).

Also, the PR on Induced-pcgs and exponent vector for polycyclic subgroups got merged [sympy/sympy#17317](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17317). 

Let's have a look at some of the highlights of documentation.

 - The parameters of both the classes(``PolycyclicGroup`` and ``Collector``) has been discussed in detail.
 - Conditions for a word to be collected or uncollected is highlighted.
 - Computation of polycyclic presentation has been explained in detail highlighting the sequence in which presentation is computed with the corresponding pcgs and and polycyclic series elements used.
 - Other methods like ``subword_index``, ``exponent_vector``, ``depth``, etc are also documented.

An example is provided for every functionality.
For more details one can visit:
[https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/combinatorics/pc_groups.html](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/combinatorics/pc_groups.html)

Now, I'm supposed to prepare a final report presenting all the work done. Will update with report next week.
In addition to the report preparation I'll try to add ``Parameters`` section in the `docstrings` for various classes and methods of ``pc_groups``.
